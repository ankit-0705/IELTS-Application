# IELTS Application – Modern Responsive IELTS Prep Platform

## Overview

IELTS Application is a clean, professionally designed responsive web application for IELTS (International English Language Testing System) preparation. It offers a smooth user experience on all devices and a premium, app-like feel.

- **Tech Stack:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Brand:** Custom-designed app logo and favicon for a unique, trustworthy presence

## Features

- **Modern Hero Section:** Stands out with compelling headline, expert tagline, and bold "Start Learning" CTA. Responsive image and gradient overlays for engagement.
- **Floating Features Box:** Showcases key offerings (Speaking Practice, Mock Tests, AI Band Score, Expert Tutors) in a visually appealing, clickable, horizontal "card" layout. Instantly navigates to corresponding info sections.
- **Testimonials:** Live feedback from real users/mentors, displayed as elegant cards. On desktop, user name and post appear as tooltips when hovering over their photo for a refined, interactive feel.
- **Deep IELTS Section:** Each feature (Speaking, Mock, AI, Tutors) has an extended, professional description and visuals, supporting adaptive layout for mobile/tablet/PC.
- **Footer:** Brand, mission statement, and company/legal/service links are cleanly arranged—always fully centered and readable on mobile.

## Design and UX Approach

- **Fully Responsive:** Every component and layout gracefully adapts for large desktop screens, tablets, and mobile.
- **Glassmorphism and Shadows:** Key overlays use glassy, blurred backgrounds and modern drop shadows, especially in navbar and mobile menus.
- **Animated Mobile Menu:** Hamburger icon smoothly morphs into a cross. Mobile dropdown menu is glassy, right-aligned, and never covers main content.
- **Accessible:** All images include alt text. Buttons are keyboard and screen reader friendly.

## Custom Branding

- **Personalized Logo and Favicons:** The application includes original logo artwork and matching favicon, ensuring a professional, ownable digital identity.
- **No Generic Assets:** Every visual is tailored for IELTS Application—no default or stock branding.
